Algorithms: Bit Manipulation
Below are some notes on ~, >> and << bitwise operators.

NOT operator ~

Result is 0 when bit is 1 and 1 when bit is 0
Right Shift >>

leftOperand >> rightOperand
leftOperand: whose bits get right shifted
rightOperand: Decides number of places to shift the bits
Example: 0x02 >> 1 = 0x01
When bits are shifted right the leading positions are filled with zeros
It is equivalent to division by 2rightOperand
Example: 0x02 >> 1 == 0x02 / 21
Left Shift <<

leftOperand << rightOperand
leftOperand: whose bits get right shifted
rightOperand: Decides number of places to shift the bits
Example: 0x01 << 1 = 0x02
When bits are shifted left the trailing positions are filled with zeros
It is equivalent to multiplication by 2rightOperand
Example: 0x01 << 1 == 0x01 / 21
Tasks
All *-main.c are in the main directory.
0 : A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);
Where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars.
Return: the converted number, or 0 if
there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1
b is NULL
To enable debug mode that will print statements of what is happening add this -D DEBUG at the end of the compile line.
Compile the code this way: gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 main/0-main.c 0-binary_to_uint.c -o a
1 : A function that prints the binary representation of a number.
Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);
Format: see below.

You are not allowed to use arrays.
You are not allowed to use malloc
You are not allowed to use the % or / operators.
If you are here for a solution for ALX, checker version.
To enable debug mode that will print statements of what is happening add this -D DEBUG at the end of the compile line.
Compile the code this way: gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 main/1-main.c 1-print_binary.c _putchar.c -o b
10 : A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
Prototype: int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index);
Where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to get.
Returns: the value of the bit at index index or -1 if an eror occured.

11 : A function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
Prototype: int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set.
Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occurred.

100 : A function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
Prototype: int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);
Where index is the index, starting from 0 of the bit you want to set.
Returns: 1 if it worked, or -1 if an error occured.

101 : A function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
Prototype: unsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);
You are not allowed to use the % or / operators.
If you are here for a solution for ALX, checker version.
To enable debug mode that will print statements of what is happening add this -D DEBUG at the end of the compile line.

Endianness : A function that checks the endianness.
Prototype: int get_endianness(void);
Returns: 0 if big endian, 1 if little endian.
